# To-do-list
To-do list that dynamically creates To-dos and even subfolders where you can put in your to-dos based on priority etc.

my todo-items are going to have 
- A title
- Description
- dueDate
- Priority
- Notes
- Checklist

My to-do list should have
- Separate lists or projects of todos
- When the user opens the app it should show the 'default' project to
which all of their todos are put
- Users are able to create new projects and choose which project their
todos go into

Application logic 

- Creating new todos
- Setting todos as complete
- Changing todo priority
- deleting existing todos
- deleting existing projects


To-do interface 
- View all projects
- View all todos in each project (Title and date)
- expand a single todo to see/edit its details
